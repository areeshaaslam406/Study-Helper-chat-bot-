An interactive AI-powered chatbot designed to assist students with studying, understanding concepts, and testing their knowledge through quizzes. This project leverages Python and `ipywidgets` to create a responsive and engaging learning interface.


## 🚀 Features

- **Topic Explanation**  
  Get detailed explanations for academic subjects including Biology, Computer Science, and Mathematics.  
  Example: `Explain Photosynthesis` or `Tell me about AI`.

- **Definitions**  
  Quickly get definitions of technical terms in programming and other subjects.  
  Example: `Define algorithm` or `What is OOP?`

- **Interactive Quizzes**  
  Test your knowledge with quizzes on specific topics or general knowledge. Instant feedback is provided for each answer.  
  Example: `Quiz me on Python`

- **Study Tips**  
  Randomized practical study strategies to enhance learning and retention.  
  Example: `Give me a study tip`

- **Related Topics**  
  Each topic includes references to related concepts for deeper understanding.

- **Formula Support**  
  Scientific and mathematical formulas are displayed for relevant topics.


## 🧩 Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Libraries:**
  - `ipywidgets` – for interactive user interface
  - `IPython.display` – to display messages and markdown
  - `datetime`, `random`, `re` – for logic and quiz handling


## 📖 How It Works

1. **User Input:** Type messages in the chat interface.
2. **Topic Recognition:** The bot recognizes topics, keywords, or quiz requests.
3. **Response Generation:** The bot provides explanations, definitions, study tips, or quiz questions.
4. **Interactive Quizzes:**  
   - Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) and Short Answer types  
   - Immediate feedback and scoring  
   - Time tracking and performance summary



## 💻 Usage

1. Run the Python notebook containing the chatbot code.
2. Use the chat interface to interact with the bot:
   - Example commands:
     - `"Explain AI"`
     - `"Define algorithm"`
     - `"Quiz me on Python"`
     - `"Give me a study tip"`
3. Answer quiz questions by typing either the full answer or the number for MCQs.
4. View your final score and feedback at the end of each quiz.
